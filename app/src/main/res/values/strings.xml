            What is Hepatitis A:
        </h3>
        <p style="test-align:justify">
            Hepatitis A (formerly known as infectious hepatitis) is an acute infectious disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Causes:        </h3>
        <p>
            You can catch the disease if you drink water or food that been contaminated
            with the stool of someone with the virus.
            You can also get infected if you:
            •	Eat fruits, vegetables, or other foods that were contaminated during handling
            •	Eat raw shellfish harvested from water that got the virus in it
            •	Swallow contaminated ice.

        <h3>            Symtomps:</h3>
        <p>
            Polio, in its most debilitating forms, displays symptoms such as paralysis and death. However, most people with polio do not actually display any symptoms or become noticeably sick. When symptoms do appear, there are differences depending on the type of polio.
            Nonparalytic polio (abortive poliomyelitis) leads to flu-like symptoms that last for a few days or weeks, such asfever, sore throat, headache, vomiting, fatigue, back and neck pain, arm and leg stiffness, muscle tenderness, muscle spasms, and meningitis.
            Treatments for polio

            There is no cure for polio once a person becomes infected. Therefore, treatments are focused on increasing comfort, managing symptoms, and preventing complications. This may include providing bed rest, antibiotics for additional infections, pain killers, ventilators to help breathing, physiotherapy and moderate exercise, and a proper diet.


        </p>
        <h3> Treatment:</h3>
        <p>
            No specific treatment for hepatitis A is known. Sufferers are advised to rest, avoid fatty foods and alcohol (these may be poorly tolerated for some additional months during the recovery phase and cause minor relapses), eat a well-balanced diet, and stay hydrated.[38]based on the type of parasite that you have. In some instances, the medication prescribed will not be effective. Drug-resistant parasites have been reported. These parasites make many drugs ineffective. If this occurs, your doctor may need to change medications or use more than one medication to treat your condition

            What is typhoid fever?


        </h3>
        <p style="test-align:justify">
            Typhoid fever is an acute illness associated with fever caused by theSalmonella typhi bacteria. It can also be caused by Salmonella paratyphi, a related bacterium that usually causes a less severe illness. The bacteria are deposited in water or food by a human carrier and are then spread to other people in the area.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Causes of Typhoid:       </h3>
        <p>
            Typhoid is usually transmitted by water or food, in much the same way as cholera. People who are infected excrete live bacteria in their feces and urine. They are usually contagious for a few days before any symptoms develop, so they do not know they need to take extra precautions. If they do not wash their hands properly, the typhoid bacillus can be transferred to food or water and from there to another person. Also, it can be spread directly from person to person via contaminated fingers.


        </p>
        <h3>            Symtomps:</h3>
        <p>
            Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 weeks after infection but may take as long as 3 weeks to appear. Typhoid usually causes a high, sustained fever, often as high as 40 degree C (10degree F), and extreme exhaustion.
            Other common symptoms include:
            •	constipation
            •	cough
            •	headache
            •	loss of appetite
            •	stomach pains
            •	sore throat
            Rarer symptoms include:
            •	bleeding from the rectum
            •	delirium
            •	diarrhea
            •	temporary pink spots on the chest and abdomen


            There is no cure for polio once a person becomes infected. Therefore, treatments are focused on increasing comfort, managing symptoms, and preventing complications. This may include providing bed rest, antibiotics for additional infections, pain killers, ventilators to help breathing, physiotherapy and moderate exercise, and a proper diet.


        </p>
        <h3> Treatment:</h3>
        <p>
            With antibiotic treatment, symptoms start to subside after 5 to 7 days, but without treatment they continue to get worse for several weeks, and more than 10% of untreated people may die.
            A small number of people who recover from typhoid may have a relapse of their symptoms just a few weeks later. The second bout tends to be less severe than the first, and clears up quickly with further treatment.
            Many people suffer from mild intestinal bleeding, but it is severe in only a small minority of cases. The main way typhoid kills is by causing perforation of the small intestines, causing bacteria to pour into the abdominal cavity. This condition is calledperitonitis, and is often fatal.

            Causes of Polio:       </h3>
        <p>
            Polio is caused by the poliovirus, a highly contagious virus specific to humans. The virus usually enters the environment in the feces of someone who is infected. In areas with poor sanitation, the virus easily spreads through the fecal-oral route, via contaminated water or food. In addition, direct contact with a person infected with the virus can cause polio.

            What is Rabics?


        </h3>
        <p style="test-align:justify">
            Typhoid fever is an acute illness associated with fever caused by theSalmonella typhi bacteria. It can also be caused by Salmonella paratyphi, a related bacterium that usually causes a less severe illness. The bacteria are deposited in water or food by a human carrier and are then spread to other people in the area.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Causes of Rabics:       </h3>
        <p>
            Rabies is a viral illness spread via the saliva of an infected animal. This occurs usually through biting a human or another animal. Transmission can also occur through saliva touching an open wound or touching mucous membranes.

        </p>
        <h3>            Causes</h3>
        <p>
            The bite of a rabid animal is the most common cause of rabies. The virus is carried in the saliva of the rabid animal and is able to enter the body through an opening in the skin, such as a bite wound. Although it is possible to get rabies from a non-bite exposure, this is very rare. For example, non-bite exposures include inhalation of aerosol particles of the virus, or by a rabid animal licking a persons eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin.


        </p>
        <h3> Treatment:</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment to prevent rabies has three essential components if a high probability of viral transmission exists. Depending on the likelihood the animal has rabies and, in some cases, the availability of the animal for observation, your doctor may not initiate the latter two steps involving shots against the rabies virus.
            •	Wound care involving soap and a virus-killing cleanser (this should always be done for any animal bite)
            •	A onetime injection of human rabiesimmune globulin (or HRIG), which is a substance that provides rapid, short-term protection against rabies
            •	Injection of the first of a series of vaccine doses to provide protection against rabies after an exposure

            What is Tetanus?


        </h3>
        <p style="test-align:justify">
            •	Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by contamination of wounds with the bacteria Clostridium tetani, and/or the spores they produce that live in the soil and animal feces.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Causes of Teteanus:       </h3>
        <p>
            Rabies is a viral illness spread via the saliva of an infected animal.
            This occurs usually through biting a human or another animal. Transmission can
            also occur through saliva touching an open wound or touching mucous membranes.

        </p>
        <h3>            Causes</h3>
        <p>
            Tetanus usually occurs when a wound becomes contaminated withClostridium tetani bacterial spores. Infection follows when spores become activated and develop into gram-positive bacteria that multiply and produce a very powerful toxin (tetanospasmin) that affects the muscles. Tetanus spores are found throughout the environment, usually in soil, dust, and animal waste. The usual locations for the bacteria to enter the body are puncture wounds, such as those caused by rusty nails, splinters, or even insect bites


        </p>
        <h3> Treatment:</h3>
        <p>
            Vaccination can prevent tetanus infections, but only if you receive your booster shots on schedule. If you are not sure whether you are up-to-date on your shots,

        <p>
            Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera, is usually found in food or water contaminated by feces from a person with the infection. Common sources include:
            	Municipal water supplies
            	Ice made from municipal water
            	Foods and drinks sold by street vendors
            	Vegetables grown with water containing human wastes
            	Raw or undercooked fish and seafood caught in waters polluted with sewage

        </p>
        <h3>            Symtomps</h3>
        <p>
            Symptoms of cholera can begin as soon as a few hours or as long as five days after infection. Often, symptoms are mild. But sometimes they are very serious. About one in 20 people infected have severe waterydiarrhea accompanied by vomiting, which can quickly lead todehydration. Although many infected people may have minimal or no symptoms, they can still contribute to spread of the infection.
